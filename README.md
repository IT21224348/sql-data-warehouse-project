# 🏗️ Data Warehouse Project – Bronze, Silver, Gold Architecture

## 📚 Project Overview

This project involves building a robust **Data Warehouse** using **SQL**, structured around the **Bronze, Silver, and Gold** layer architecture. The main objective is to organize, clean, and transform raw data into valuable business insights through a layered and scalable pipeline.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

### 1. **Bronze Layer** – *Raw Ingestion Layer*
- **Purpose:** Stores raw data ingested from various source systems (e.g., transactional databases, logs, files, APIs).
- **Features:**
  - No transformations applied.
  - Schema-on-read approach.
  - Ideal for data archiving and traceability.
  - Helps with reprocessing and debugging.

### 2. **Silver Layer** – *Cleaned and Transformed Layer*
- **Purpose:** Applies necessary cleaning, filtering, and standard transformations.
- **Features:**
  - Data validation (null checks, type corrections).
  - Standardization of formats (dates, currency, IDs).
  - Removal of duplicates and bad records.
  - Joins and enrichment using multiple sources.

### 3. **Gold Layer** – *Business-Ready Layer*
- **Purpose:** Provides analytics-ready data models used for dashboards, reports, and machine learning models.
- **Features:**
  - Aggregations, KPIs, and metrics.
  - Star/Snowflake schemas for reporting.
  - Optimized for query performance and consumption.
  - Supports decision-making and BI tools.
